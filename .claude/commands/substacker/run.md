Invoke the `substacker-pipeline` skill to run the full Substacker article pipeline with an agent team.

This spawns a 3-member team (Researcher, Writer, Artist) orchestrated by you as Team Lead. The pipeline runs: discover → outline → write → images → publish, with user approval between each stage.

If a slug or topic argument is provided, use it to seed the pipeline. Otherwise, start with topic discovery.
